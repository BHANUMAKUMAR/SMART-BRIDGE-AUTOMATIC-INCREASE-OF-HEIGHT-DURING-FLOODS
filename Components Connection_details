7.Cardboard Bridge Model

CONNECTIONS:
Connection Details
1. Servo Motor 1 (Left Motor)

Signal (Orange/Yellow wire) → Arduino Pin 9

VCC (Red wire) → Arduino 5V

GND (Brown/Black wire) → Arduino GND

2. Servo Motor 2 (Right Motor)
Signal (Orange/Yellow wire) → Arduino Pin 10

VCC (Red wire) → Arduino 5V

GND (Brown/Black wire) → Arduino GND

Tip: If your servo motors draw too much power from Arduino, consider powering them through an external 5V power source and connecting the grounds (GND) together.

3. Soil Moisture Sensor

VCC → Arduino 5V

GND → Arduino GND

Analog Output (AO) → Arduino Analog Pin A0

This sensor reads analog voltage based on soil/water moisture content, which is processed via analogRead(A0) in your code.
